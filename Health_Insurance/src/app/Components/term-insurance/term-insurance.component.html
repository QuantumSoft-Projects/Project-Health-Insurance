      <h2>Why Do You Need Term Insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        Term insurance is a pure life insurance policy that ensures your family is financially protected in your absence. In case of your untimely demise during the policy period, your nominee receives a lump sum amount known as the sum assured.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s an essential financial tool for anyone with dependents, loans, or long-term financial responsibilities. The payout helps your family maintain their lifestyle, repay debts, and meet future goals like education, marriage, or retirement planning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern term plans come with flexible features including coverage for critical illnesses, accidental death, and disability. Some plans also offer the option of return of premium, where all premiums are refunded if the policyholder survives the term.
      </p>
      <p>
        By investing in term insurance early, you benefit from low premiums and ensure long-term security. It’s one of the most cost-effective ways to build a financial shield for your loved ones.
