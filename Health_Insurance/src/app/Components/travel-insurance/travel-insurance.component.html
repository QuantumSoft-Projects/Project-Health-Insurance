      <h2>Why Do You Need Travel Insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        Travel insurance is a safety net that provides coverage for unexpected events during your trip, including trip cancellations, medical emergencies, lost luggage, or flight delays. With the uncertainties that come with traveling, having travel insurance ensures peace of mind so you can enjoy your trip without worrying about unforeseen incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're traveling for business or leisure, travel insurance protects you from financial loss and helps you manage the unexpected. It is especially important for international trips, where healthcare costs and travel disruptions can be significant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many travel insurance plans also offer additional benefits such as 24/7 emergency assistance, coverage for adventure activities, and trip interruption reimbursement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, travel insurance can offer coverage for lost or delayed baggage, personal liability, and cancellation fees, making it a smart investment for any traveler.
